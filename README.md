🚨 **Spam Detection with NLP — Filtering Out the Noise!** 💬

Over the last few days, I’ve been working on a classic but crucial NLP project: **Spam Mail Detection**.

Using Python and **NLTK**, I built a pipeline to:
✅ Preprocess raw text (remove punctuation, lowercase, stopwords)
✅ Extract meaningful features from messages
✅ Prepare labeled data to classify as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**
✅ Set the foundation for a machine learning classifier
🔍 What I Did:
✅ Preprocessed raw messages using NLTK:

Lowercasing, punctuation removal, tokenization, and stopword filtering
✅ Built a neural network using TensorFlow & Keras
✅ Trained the model to classify messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam)
✅ Achieved an impressive 98% accuracy on the test spam

📊 The insights from this are powerful — even basic text cleaning can dramatically improve model performance!

🔧 Tools & Libraries:
`NLTK`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` — all open-source, simple, and effective.

🎯 Next up: I’ll be integrating **ML models like Naive Bayes** and possibly deploying this via a **Flask API**.

🧠 Text classification is a skill every data scientist should master. If you're working on NLP or interested in spam filters — let’s connect or collaborate!
